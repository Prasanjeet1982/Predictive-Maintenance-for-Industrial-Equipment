# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

This is a predictive maintenance project that uses machine learning to predict equipment failures in industrial settings. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and a FastAPI-based web API for making real-time predictions.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the equipment sensor data.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features for the predictive model.
- Model Training: Trains a machine learning model to predict equipment failures.
- FastAPI Web API: Provides an API for making real-time predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance.git
   cd predictive-maintenance
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the equipment sensor data (`equipment_failure_data.csv`) and save it in the project directory.

4. Run the FastAPI app:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

5. Access the API by opening http://localhost:8000 in your browser or using a tool like `curl`.

## Usage

1. The FastAPI app provides an endpoint for making predictions. Send a POST request to `/predict` with JSON data containing the equipment sensor readings.

2. The API will respond with a prediction indicating whether a failure is predicted or not.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: FastAPI application code for the web API.
- `model.joblib`: Trained machine learning model saved using joblib.
- `equipment_failure_data.csv`: Sample equipment sensor data for demonstration.
