# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Equipment

This is a predictive maintenance project that uses machine learning to predict equipment failures in industrial settings. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and a FastAPI-based web API for making real-time predictions.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the equipment sensor data.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features for the predictive model.
- Model Training: Trains a machine learning model to predict equipment failures.
- FastAPI Web API: Provides an API for making real-time predictions.
